# Introduction

Working as the single devloper and operator on a somewhat busy website is sometimes good and other times really bad.
I get to choose whatever technology i want, i get to deploy the servers however i want and i also get to decide what and when to do those things.

The downside is that i then have to do all those things, all by myself. 

I've been meaning to document some of the things i learn during my exploration of programming and system administration that are new to me, with some luck it might be useful to others as well.

Next post will most likely be about Chef and how to grok The Berkshelf way...
